Current topics all look fun to me, but it will be great if we can do more examples when explaining about the encrypting methods along with the abstract algorithm(perhaps in tutorials?), it will help us understand the process better. In addition, I would also like to see more applications on how course materials are used in real life, and/or how those topics relate to real life security issues.

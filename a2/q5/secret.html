<h1>Secrets of Happiness</h1>
<ul>
<li>All happiness depends on courage and work.</li>
<li>The secret of happiness (and therefore of success) is to be in harmony with existence, to be always calm, always lucid ... to let each wave of life wash us a little farther up the shore.</li>
<li>It is neither wealth nor splendor; but tranquility and occupation which give you happiness.</li>
<li>Action may not always bring happiness; but there is no happiness without action.</li>
<li>Be happy with what you have and are, be generous with both, and you won't have to hunt for happiness.</li>
<li>True happiness comes from the joy of deeds well done, the zest of creating things new.</li>
<li>Happiness is good health and a bad memory.</li>
<li>The grand essentials of happiness are: something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.</li>
<li>Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.</li>
<li>Derive happiness in oneself from a good day's work, from illuminating the fog that surrounds us.</li>
<li>Beauty is nothing other than the promise of happiness.</li>
<li>There are shortcuts to happiness, and dancing is one of them.</li>
<li>When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy'. They told me I didn't understand the assignment, and I told them they didn't understand life.</li>
<li>Ice cream is happiness condensed.</li>
</ul>
